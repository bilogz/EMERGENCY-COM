# Compile Directory

This directory is for organizing source files that need to be compiled or processed.

## Directory Structure

- **`src/`** - Source files ready for compilation
- Additional subdirectories can be added as needed

## Purpose

Use this directory to:
- Organize files before compilation
- Store files that need special processing
- Prepare assets for build tools
- Archive files for compilation workflows

## Workflow

1. Place source files in `compile/src/` or appropriate subdirectory
2. Run build/compilation tools
3. Output goes to `build/` directory
4. Clean up temporary files after compilation
